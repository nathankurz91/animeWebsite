# My Anime Website

## Overview/Purpose

The purpose of this website is to showcase my favorite anime. There will be a page that displays an interactive list of my favorite anime.

## Some thoughts/ideas

### Initial build

- Build/prototype the website with bootstrap
- Get all of the front end pieces in place
  - Think about what backend pieces might be needed while building the frontend
  - MEAN stack
- The website will not be about me, just about the anime that I love
- Focus on a simple and clean code
- Focus on simple and clean design

### The list

1. Titles of the Anime
   1. Subtitle displaying creator?
2. Image representing the anime
   1. If the image is clicked, two things will happen
      1. A soundbite from the anime will play
      2. And the image will flip/transition to a brief description of the anime.
